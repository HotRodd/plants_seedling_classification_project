# plants_seedling_classification_project
Image classification using CNNs featuring an introduction to Computer Vision to identify the plant seedlings species from 12 different species using a convolutional neural network. 

### Skills & Tools Covered
* Keras
* CNN
* Working with images
* Computer Vision

### Data Description
This dataset contains images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species

### The data file names are:

images.npy
Label.csv

**Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to numpy arrays and stored in images.npy file (which is too large to upload into GitHub, so I apologize for not having this source file for you) and the corresponding labels are also put into Labels.csv so that you can work on the data/project seamlessly without having to worry about the high data volume.**

The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from an image.
